Robot Dynamics
==============
This directory contains the code responsible for: 
1. Generating the dynamics of the delta robot symbolically both using the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations,
2. Generating the dynamics of the gripper symbolically using the Newtonian formulation,
3. Generating the expressions necessary for computing the forward kinematics numerically,
4. Generating the expressions necessary for computing the inverse kinematics analytically,
5. Performing both open- and closed-loop simulations of the delta robot,
6. Performing both open- and closed-loop simulations of the gripper,and 
7. Visualizing the robot's workspace.
